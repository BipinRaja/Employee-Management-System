The system as such as it has been developed is called Employee Management System. It consists of functionally related GUI (application program) and database.
	Most of the contemporary Information systems are based on the Database technology as a collection of logically related data, and DBMS as a software system allowing the users to define, create, maintain and control access to the database. The process of constructing such kind of systems is not so simple. It involves a mutual development of application program and database. The application program is actually the bridge between the users and the database, where the data is stored. Thus, the well-developed application program and database are very important for the reliability, flexibility and functionality of the system. The so defined systems differentiate to each other and their development comprises a great variety of tasks to be resolved and implemented. The basic idea can be depicted on Figure 1.1 below:
